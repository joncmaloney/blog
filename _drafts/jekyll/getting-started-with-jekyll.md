	what jekyll does

		Jekyll is both a web server and a static site generator. 

		After your files are created jekyll can parse these files and generate static html web pages. Jekyll is capable of serving these web pages however any web server can be used. 

		One of the key benifits of the static site generator is that the HTML pages already exist and just need to be served. No need for databases to be searched or back end servers to process the request. 

		Jekyll will also monitor changes to the sites directory and regenerate HTML pages for additional content. This make CI/CD much easier.
